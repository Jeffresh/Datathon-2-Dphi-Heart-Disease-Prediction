# Datathon 2: Machine learning bootcamp

The doctors of Health Hospital in Zastra are tired of looking at new proposals for detecting heart disease using a Machine Learning model. They wish to understand the model and not rely on a magical black box. Can you help them out by first creating a model and then explaining how these models work?
